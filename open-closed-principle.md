***It means simply this: We should write our modules so that they can be extended, without requiring them to be modified. In other words, we want to be able to change what the modules do, without changing the source code of the modules.***

***This may sound contradictory, but there are several techniques for achieving the OCP on a large scale. All of these techniques are based upon abstraction. Indeed, abstraction is the key to the OCP.*** 

Several of these techniques are described below.
