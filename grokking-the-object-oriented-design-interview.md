***The four principles of object-oriented programming are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.***

1) ***Encapsulation***: ***Encapsulation is the mechanism of binding the data together and hiding it from the outside world***. Encapsulation is achieved when each object keeps its state private so that other objects don’t have direct access to its state. Instead, they can access this state only through a set of public functions.

2) ***Abstraction***: Abstraction can be thought of as the natural extension of encapsulation. It means hiding all but the relevant data about an object in order to reduce the complexity of the system. In a large system, objects talk to each other, which makes it difficult to maintain a large code base; ***abstraction helps by hiding internal implementation details of objects and only revealing operations that are relevant to other objects.***

3) ***Inheritance***: Inheritance is the mechanism of creating new classes from existing ones

4) ***Polymorphism***: Polymorphism (from Greek, meaning “many forms”) is the ability of an object to take different forms and thus, depending upon the context, to respond to the same message in different ways. Take the example of a chess game; a chess piece can take many forms, like bishop, castle, or knight and all these pieces will respond differently to the ‘move’ message.
