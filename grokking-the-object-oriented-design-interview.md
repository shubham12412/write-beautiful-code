***The four principles of object-oriented programming are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.***

1) ***Encapsulation***: Encapsulation is the mechanism of binding the data together and hiding it from the outside world. Encapsulation is achieved when each object keeps its state private so that other objects donâ€™t have direct access to its state. Instead, they can access this state only through a set of public functions.
